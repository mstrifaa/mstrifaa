### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring systems desinger and researcher. I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. An avid learner - I like to learn about a lot of things: things related to and outside of technology. Being able to make something with my hands, learn a new tool or solve a problem gives me a sense of pleasure.
I am highly passionate about functional, safe, reliable, environment-friendly, and beautiful designs of ... just about everything. When I experience a good design, I make sure to learn from it. When I spot a bad design, I start thinking solutions for it.
I love learning and teaching. Whether kids or young adults, being able to make someone understand, and, perhaps, connect the dots of an idea makes me very happy.
I am interested in collaborating on projects related to healthcare, Internet of Things, and education. If you have any suggestion, please contact me via email.
