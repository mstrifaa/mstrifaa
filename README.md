### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring web developer, enthusiastic about the front-end more than the back-end. With a degree in CSE and a love for design and puzzles, I like making websites that are functional and pleasing to the eyes. I also have a knack for floor plans and aeroplanes. 
In my spare time, I love to browse Youtube, watch cartoons, learn a language or, simply, go outside for some fresh air.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web project.
