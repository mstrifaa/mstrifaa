### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring software developer and researcher. I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. I like to learn about technology in healthcare and environment, and I am interested to collaborate on projects geared towards using technology to improve healthcare, and the living standards of people. 
I also have a knack for maps, living space designs and product development.
