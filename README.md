### Hi there 👋

I am an aspiring software developer and researcher. I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. An avid learner - I like to learn about technology in healthcare and environment, and I am interested to collaborate on projects geared towards using technology to improve healthcare, and the living standards of people. 
I also have a knack for maps, living space designs and product development. I am highly passionate about functional, safe, reliable, environment-friendly, and beautiful designs of ... just about everything. When I experience a good design, I make sure to learn from it. When I spot a bad design, I start thinking solutions for it.
